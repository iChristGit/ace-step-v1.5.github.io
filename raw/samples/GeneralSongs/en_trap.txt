[Verse]
Woke up in the same architecture
Memory's texture, pressure's lecture
Same four walls, same projector
Groundhog cycle, same connector
Skeleton key in the same door
Same hallway, same worn floor

[Verse]
Broke the mirror, broke the measure
Broke the tether, broke the pressure
But the pieces knew their lecture
Reassembled, same texture
The shards spelled out my name backwards
Same story, same fractured actors

[Verse]
Found the pattern in the fracture
Same departure, same recapture
The loop's not outside, it's the passenger
I'm the driver and the passenger
I built the cage, I am the cage
Same script, same stage

[Chorus]
Spin the same, make it stranger
Frame the pain, rearrange it
Name the game, then derange it
Spin the same, make it stranger

[Bridge]
Round's got corners, sound's got mourners
Back's got forwards, map's got orders
Lost the compass, compass got borders
Cost the promise, promise got quarters

[Chorus]
Spin the same, make it stranger
Stack the lack, make it major
Track attack, make it wager
Spin the same, make it stranger

[Outro]
Spin the same, spin the same, spin the same
But the danger's got a new name
Same same same same same same
But the frame's got a new game
